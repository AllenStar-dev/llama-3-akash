## Akash Guide For Creating and Deploying Applications.

* Install and fund the Wallet.

     - [Kepler](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/keplr/dmkamcknogkgcdfhhbddcghachkejeap?hl=en)
    -  [Leap](https://www.leapwallet.io/#inpage-download) 

* Fund the wallet
  - You can Swap Atom to AKT on [Osomis](https://app.osmosis.zone/?from=OSMO&to=AKT)
  - Buy Atom from Centralised Exchanges.
  - Connect your Wallet to Swap.
    
* Go to [Cloudmos](https://deploy.cloudmos.io/)
* Connect your wallet again.
  - You Need to have minimum 0.5 AKT in the wallet.
- You Need to create Huggingface account and get access to the llama models.
  - Here is the link [llama](https://huggingface.co/meta-llama/Meta-Llama-3-70B-Instruct) for the huggingface model hub.
  - You then need to request for access to the models from the authors by sharing your required information.
  - Then create an [acces token](https://huggingface.co/settings/tokens) after getting access to the models
  - Use the access token and replace it with hf_yourtoken in [deploy.yaml](https://github.com/AllenStar-dev/llama-3-akash/blob/main/deploy.yaml)
